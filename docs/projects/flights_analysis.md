# Flights Analysis

## Project summary

As part of my work in the Business Finland Untangling People Flow project, I analysed flight data for Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. The goal was to be able to correlate between flights and the movement of passengers in the departure hall of the airport, and answer questions such as:

1. What are the most popular flights? 
2. Are there more flights to European (Schengen) countries, or to outside the Schengen area?
3. Which airline has the most flights in a week?
4. Can we prepare the flight data so we can estimate the number of people checking from the LiDAR data?

The flight data was provided by an open API[^1] from Finavia, the Finnish company responsible for managing and maintaining several of Finland's airports; and the analysis was performed on CSC[^2] scientific computing infrastructure.
