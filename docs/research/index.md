# Research
For over five years, I have been a computer science researcher at two different universities in Finland. My current research interests is the Internet of Things, trajectory prediction, and machine learning. 

However, during my doctoral training I had a strong focus in augmented reality, 5G, and edge computing. The majority of my [publications](publications.md) are related to such topics.
