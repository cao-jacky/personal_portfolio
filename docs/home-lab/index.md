# Home Lab

What is a *Home Lab*? I think it can basically be summed up as a self-hosted server running on any hardware, where you deploy and run your own services. It does not need to be enterprise-level data centre machines, but can be as simple and small as a laptop. However, there are of course, caveats to consider. For example, with a laptop, is it safe to have it constantly plugged in and running? Does it have enough resources to fulfil all the services that you want to run? Is it going to be cheaper than just outright paying for the services that you are trying to emulate?

Maybe not on that last point. It will probably cost more in money, time, and effort. But it is a fun endeavour, nonetheless. For me, the main purposes of my Home Lab are to:

1. Take ownership and control of the data and services that I use.
2. Learn about running and managing my own server.
3. Tinker and experiment with different technologies and services.

It is just that simple! I have a collection of Docker-based containers running services which have been created by extremely talented people, and they form the basis of my Home Lab.
