# Hardware

I began building out my Home Lab in May 2024. I had decided that I did not want to use big tech smart home platforms, pay for several media streaming services, and have my data be beholden to an external company. So, I started researching what type of hardware that I could use.

I started out with two Raspberry Pi 5 8 GBs[^1]. Two, because I accidentally bought two, and it was a faff to return one of them, so I kept both and used them as a tiny cluster. Eventually, I upgraded my setup to a GMKtec NucBox G3 Plus N150 Mini PC[^2], added a stick of 32 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD. I did have an old MacBook Pro 13" from 2015, but given that it is a laptop and I wanted my Home Lab to be always on, I decided not to use it.

Otherwise, the Mini PC has been working great. I did have some initial thermal issues with the fan spinning up at any light load, but I solved this by swapping out the thermal paste[^3] and installing an SSD cooler[^4] on the M.2 drive.

Would I want to upgrade from the Mini PC? Perhaps. If I wanted to run some local LLMs, then I was thinking that I could get a semi-specced Mac Mini M4 Pro. But I am not sure if I need that yet, or at all. What is more important for me, is to replace my external USB-A connected HDDs with one or two SSD drives to ensure data reliability.
