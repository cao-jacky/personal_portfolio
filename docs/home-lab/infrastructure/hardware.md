# Hardware

I began building out my Home Lab in May 2024, when I decided that I did not want to use big tech smart home platforms, pay for several different media streaming services, and have my data be beholden to an external company.  
   
I started out with two Raspberry Pi 5 8 GBs. Two, because I accidentally bought two, and it was a faff to return one of them. Eventually, I upgraded my setup to a GMKtec NucBox G3 Plus N150 Mini PC, added a stick of 32 GB RAM, and a 2 TB SSD.

The Mini PC has been working great. I did have some initial thermal issues with the fan spinning up at any light load, but I solved this by swapping out the thermal paste[^1] and installing an SSD cooler[^2] on the M.2 drive.
