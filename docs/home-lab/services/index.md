# Services

As with any good Home Lab tinkerer, I have tested a wide variety of services and I am still continually finding new ones to complement my existing set. Some tested services end up not being that useful to me, so I just simply turn them off and archive them — simple as!

I would say that I use a fair number of services, mostly replacing “traditional” software that I would have otherwise paid a subscription for.

Below is a summary of my Home Lab services, their categorisation, and what I use them for. Furthermore, I have chosen a few of them and wrote about their deployment in more details.
