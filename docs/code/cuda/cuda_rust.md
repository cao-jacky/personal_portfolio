# CUDA and Rust

I want to improve my CUDA programming skills, and I thought, what better way, than to approach this with the Advent of Code and its programming challenges. I did a cursory search online of, "cuda programming advent of code", and found that someone else has already approached and done this[^1]. So it seems like a potentially good idea! They went a step further and combined CUDA programming with Rust.

Now I am wondering whether I should take up learning Rust as well? It could be a double interesting challenge, but also would be doubly challenging. There is a way to get started with Rust and CUDA, I wonder if my computing configuration can support this[^2].
