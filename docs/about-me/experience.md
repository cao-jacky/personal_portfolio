# Experience

## University of Helsinki, Finland

**Postdoctoral researcher**: *April 2024–December 2025*

I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [6G research group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/6g-research){:target="_blank"} at the Department of Computer Science. I worked in the [Untangling People Flow](https://untanglingpeopleflow.com/){:target="_blank"} project and consortium, and I was previously subcontracted to perform research for Nokia Bell Labs (Network Systems and Security Research Lab) in a joint project with the University of Helsinki, "data efficiency techniques for mobile networks.".

- Designed and deployed Python-based data pipelines to extract insights from large-scale LiDAR datasets, supporting data-driven urban innovation and optimisation.
- Built and showcased a proof-of-concept computer vision prototype at the 2024 Nokia Foundation Awards, improving data-sharing efficiency.
- Collaborated with Nokia Bell Labs on applied R&D, leading to two granted patents for innovative data-processing techniques.
- Produced clear technical documentation and reports supporting technology adoption and decision-making.

**Visiting researcher**: *December 2023–March 2024*

I was a visiting researcher to the [6G research group](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/6g-research){:target="_blank"} at the Department of Computer Science. I researched the enhancement of networking for extended reality communications.

## NTNU, Norway (Remote)

**Researcher**: *October 2021–May 2022*

I was a researcher and had split institution affiliation between the University of Oulu and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

- Led a distributed team to prototype and evaluate augmented reality and AI-driven frameworks through iterative, experiment-based development.
- Applied agile methodologies to deliver validated technical proofs-of-concept, one of which progressed to a published applied solution.
- Guided students through hypothesis formulation, experiment design, and evaluation, strengthening mentoring and systems thinking skills.

## University of Oulu, Finland

**Doctoral researcher**: *August 2019–February 2024*

I was a doctoral researcher in the iEdge research group (now [Future Computing Group](https://www.oulu.fi/en/research-groups/future-computing-group){:target="_blank"}) at the Centre for Ubiquitous Computing. My main research was on 5G edge-enhanced mobile augmented reality.

- Developed and tested C++ and Java-based augmented reality systems integrated with 5G edge computing, improving latency and user experience through iterative experimentation.
- Designed data analysis pipelines in Python to assess prototype performance, applying quantitative metrics and user data for evaluation.
- Coordinated cross-functional R&D collaborations across cloud, IoT, and augmented reality, translating emerging technologies into tangible prototypes.
- Authored 16 international publications, refining the ability to communicate complex findings in clear, decision-ready formats.
