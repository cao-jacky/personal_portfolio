# About me

Hello! My name is Jacky, and I am a research engineer. Raised in Manchester, I eventually moved to Finland where I now live in Vantaa, Finland. I studied computer science at the University of Oulu, and prior to that, physics at Durham University.

I have an interest in using computer programming to solve problems, create prototypes to research ideas, and to apply it to create interesting services. The reason I have this website is to collect together the things which I find interesting and that I would like to share with others.

In addition to information about my [experience](experience.md) and [education](education.md), I also showcase some of my [projects](../projects/index.md), highlight some of the [programming](../programming/index.md) that I do, and share insights about running a [Home Lab](../home-lab/index.md).

You might find it as interesting as I do, and if so, welcome! If not, still, welcome!
