# Research

Between 2019 and 2025, I was a researcher in computer science at two different universities in Finland. My current research interests are the Internet of Things, trajectory prediction, and machine learning.

However, during my doctoral training, I had a strong focus in augmented reality, 5G, and edge computing. The majority of my [publications](publications.md) are related to such topics.
