Hello! I am a researcher in computer science in the 6G research group at the [University of Helsinki](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/jacky-cao/){:target="_blank"}.

### Summary
My current research focus is the Internet of Things, trajectory prediction, and machine learning.

I previously worked at the University of Oulu as a doctoral researcher, and at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology as a researcher. I am awaiting the completion of my doctoral degree from the University of Oulu.

I am originally from Manchester, UK, but I have also lived in Durham where I completed an integrated master's degree in physics from Durham University. However, I currently live in Vantaa, Finland.
