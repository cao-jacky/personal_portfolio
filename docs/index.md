Hello! I am a research engineer with five years of experience in data analysis, IoT, and augmented reality.

## Summary

I previously worked as a computer science researcher at the University of Helsinki, the University of Oulu, and at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

I am originally from Manchester (UK), but I have also lived in Durham (UK) where I completed an integrated master's degree in physics from Durham University. However, I currently live in Vantaa (Finland).
