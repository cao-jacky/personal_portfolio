Hello! I am a research engineer with five years of experience in data analysis and prototyping for IoT, and augmented reality. I am currently looking for work opportunities, please reach out if I seem like a suitable fit for your team!

## Summary

I previously worked as a computer science researcher at the University of Helsinki, the University of Oulu, and at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

I am originally from Manchester, UK, but I have also lived in Durham, UK where I completed an integrated master's degree in physics from Durham University. I came to Finland in 2019, firstly to Oulu, and then later moved to Vantaa, where I now reside.
