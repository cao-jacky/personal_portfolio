## University of Oulu, Finland
**Doctoral researcher**: *August 2019 - February 2024*

I was a doctoral researcher in the iEdge research group (now [Future Computing Group](https://www.oulu.fi/en/research-groups/future-computing-group){:target="_blank"}) at the Centre for Ubiquitous Computing. My main research was on 5G edge-enhanced mobile augmented reality.

- I researched the performance of 5G edge infrastructure for computer vision–based mobile augmented reality systems.
- I researched the usage of 5G edge computing to support context-aware mobile augmented reality navigation on a HoloLens 2.
- I conducted a wide-ranging survey on mobile augmented reality and the user interfaces, frameworks, and artificial intelligence methods used to support it.
- I evaluated multimedia and transport protocols for mobile augmented reality multimedia transfer over 5G edge infrastructure between user clients and servers.
- I researched how edge computing can be used to support WebXR-based real-time mobile augmented reality applications.
- I researched how mobile augmented reality and smart sensing can be used to support social distancing.
- I researched the usage of service orchestration for deploying stateful and stateless mobile augmented reality systems over edge infrastructure.
