![Big-O Complexities](../images/big_o_complexities.png)

[O(N^2)](on2_complexity.md) is not the only type of time and space complexity, there are others[^1]. The figure shows some of the other types[^2], these are classed under the name of Big-O complexity, where the best performant time complexity is O(1), i.e., not depending on the input size and has a constant time complexity.
