# Data Science

In my role as a [researcher](../../about-me/experience.md) and from completing [programming challenges](../programming_challenges/index.md), I have encountered various aspects of data science. For example, with [Advent of Code](../programming_challenges/advent_of_code.md) problems, I have been learning and understanding about different data structures and algorithms. Similarly, in my work, I created and manipulated data structures.

This collection of topics is what I have gathered together to deem as important. It might seem trivial for people who have been trained in data science, but I am self-taught. I studied physics at university and my research was always changing so I had to learn and use what was necessary in the moment.

Still, never too late!
