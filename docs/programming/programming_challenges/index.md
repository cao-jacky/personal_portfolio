# Programming Challenges

I like solving problems with computer programming, and thankfully, there are a wealth of pre-made challenges out there that I can attempt to solve. They test not just my ability to write a piece of code, but also my mathematical skills. Additionally, I can use these problems to learn new programming skills. For example, whilst I started solving [Advent of Code](advent_of_code.md) problems in 2020 to sharpen my Python skills, I am now solving [LeetGPU](leetgpu.md) challenges to help me learn GPU programming. I have no doubt that there are other platforms out there, but I have my small set of websites for now to keep me busy.
