# Languages

My programming background is rooted in Python. As a physicist, I used Python to solve a variety of physics and astrophysics problems[^1] and to model cosmological behaviours[^2]. More recently, as a computer scientist, I was using Python to perform data analysis and to create data pipelines. Furthermore, I used it to create research prototypes for IoT and augmented reality research.

In this latter work, I also worked with C, C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, and Matlab. However, my primary preference and go-to language would still be Python. Of course, this depends on the type of problem being solved.
