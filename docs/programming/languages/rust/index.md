# Rust

I am interested in learning and using Rust for data science. Of course, there is Python and the large numbers of available libraries which make data analysis a breeze. However, I cannot stop thinking about the overhead that Python has when compared to something like Rust. Furthermore, it is not like Rust does not have libraries as well, for example, [Polars](https://pola.rs/){:target="_blank"}, a library for data manipulation on Python has a Rust implementation as well. Which begs the questions, why should we not use Rust for doing data analysis?

Thankfully, there are resources to do so and people have handily collected it all together, e.g., articles[^1], repositories of code[^2], etc. My goal with this is to see if I can now use Rust as much as possible for data science. In time, there is probably a need for me to learn more about Rust, and thankfully, there are guides to do so[^3].
