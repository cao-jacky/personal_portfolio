# Python

I have used Python for over a decade now, starting from just before my physics degree at Durham University. I began making little scripts to automate stuff on my laptop, but then I learnt more about data analysis and problem solving for computational physics, and eventually, using it to conduct computer science experiments and performing big data data analytics.

I think it's a great language and incredibly versatile and powerful, even if there might be some overhead!
