# CUDA

Here are my notes and code snippets for trying to learn more about CUDA programming. My goal is to learn more about GPU programming in general, but I will start with CUDA-based programming. I am using [LeetGPU](../../programming_challenges/leetgpu.md) as one of my main resources to learn about CUDA, i.e., learning through doing.

!!! Warning "Nota bene"
    I am by no means an expert and whatever I write here, could be completely wrong. I am learning and these are my notes. Use your own fact-checking skills to verify my code.
