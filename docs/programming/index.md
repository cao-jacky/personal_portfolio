# Programming

Here is my collection of random code snippets, my own documentation on learning new programming [languages](languages/index.md), solutions to [programming challenges](programming_challenges/index.md), or whatever I deemed interesting to document. I was inspired to make such a library of code after realising that I was re-using a lot of similar techniques in my data analysis and when I was solving problems for the [Advent of Code](programming_challenges/advent_of_code.md).

This is mainly for my own benefit, but feel free to explore!
