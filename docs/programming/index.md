# Programming

Here is my collection of random code snippets, my own documentation on learning new programming [languages](languages/index.md), solutions to programming challenges, or whatever I deemed interesting to document. I was inspired to make such a library of code after realising that I was re-using a lot of similar techniques in my data analysis and when I was solving problems for the [Advent of Code](https://github.com/cao-jacky/adventofcode){:target="_blank"}.

This is mainly for my own benefit, but feel free to explore!
